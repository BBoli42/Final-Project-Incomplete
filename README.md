## Project Description
This project should allow users to see a list of parks in a state, a description of parks, and to create a list of parks. Additionally, they should be able to see well formatted webpages that allow them to click back and forth. One route will allow them to input a state and get a list of parks in a state and another route they can input a park and it will give them a description of that park, if there is one.

## How to run
1. install all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2.  Second, you should nat_park_soup.py
3.  Third, you should run SI507project_tools.py
## How to use
1.  Run nat_park_soup
2.  Run SI507project_tools
3.  When file is running go to localhost:5000
4. Navigate from the home screen to the first form
(Optional): Markdown syntax to include an screenshot/image: ![alt

## Routes in this application
-  `/home` -> this is the home page
-  `/form1` -> this form should take a state as an input
-  `/result` -> the result should be a list of parks in a state
-  `/form1` -> this form should take a park as an input
-  `/result` -> the result should be a description of a park
## How to run tests
1.  First run SI507project_test.py
2.  Second (e.g. any other setup necessary)
3.  etc (e.g. run the specific test file)
NOTE: Need not have 3 steps, but should have as many as are appropriate!
